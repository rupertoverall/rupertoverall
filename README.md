I am a scientist researching the genetics behind brain ageing.
I work in the fields of quantitative genetics, multimetric behaviour analysis and systems biology. 
Several open source software projects and the analysis code for some of my published papers are hosted here.

I am the author of the R package <a href="https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/">Rtrack</a> (on <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rtrack">CRAN</a>; development version/source <a href="https://github.com/rupertoverall/Rtrack">here</a>).
I am also the author of the R package <a href="https://rupertoverall.net/ColonyTrack/">ColonyTrack</a> (source <a href="https://github.com/rupertoverall/ColonyTrack">here</a>).

I maintain several web projects including <a href="https://rupertoverall.net/covidminer/">COVIDminer</a> and <a href="https://rupertoverall.net/neurogenesis-miner/">NeurogenesisMiner</a> (text mining resources to aid curation of molecular pathway maps) as well as the <a href="http://mango.adult-neurogenesis.de/">Mammalian Adult Neurogenesis Gene Ontology</a>.
